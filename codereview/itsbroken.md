## "It's broken" is not on-topic {#introduction}
Code that isn't working or not fully implemented is not ready for review. 

> Code Review aims to help improve working code. [...] Code Review is also not the place to ask for implementing new features.

See [What topics can I ask about here?](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic)

## Why this is a problem {#whythisisaproblem}
> "Code Review answers can be much more productive when the code is working correctly. Putting the question on hold gives you a chance to fix obvious problems. Once answers start rolling in, you will no longer be allowed to alter the code in the question, since it would be unfair for reviewers to evaluate a moving target."

## Why this is worth a downvote {#whythisisworthadownvote}
If code reviews were given on broken code, then when the code is fixed, the existing answers would likely become invalidated. This would waste the time of the users who supplied the reviews.

## What to do next {#whattodonext}
Fix your code, and ensure you gave enough description of what the code should do. Also, ensure that the title descibes the code and not your goals for code review. 

If you do not know *why* your code did not work, that suggests you have not debugged it. Debugging is one of the first steps developers take when their code fails, and is an important skill to learn. Not debugging your code is also worth a downvote. To learn why, and for hints on how to debug your code, see our ["No Debugging" page](http://idownvotedbecau.se/nodebugging/).
